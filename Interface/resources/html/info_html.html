<h1>Software Information Page</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Student Success Predictive Tool is an advanced AI-driven application designed to assist academic advisors in predicting the likelihood of student outcomes such as graduation, enrollment, or dropout. Built on machine learning techniques and based on historical academic and socio-economic data, this tool can provide actionable insights, empowering educational institutions to implement timely interventions and support strategies.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>AI-Driven Predictions:</strong> Model trained on historical data can predict students’ likelihood of success or dropout based on student information.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Designed for academic advisors to use with minimal effort.</li>
    <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Outputs are aimed to facilitate targeted academic interventions.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilizes open-source dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</li>
            <li>Achieves performance using techniques like PyTorch-based neural networks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Results:</strong> Save prediction results for further analysis and documentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Input:</strong> Advisors input student-related metrics such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Academic performance</li>
            <li>Family and socio-economic background</li>
            <li>Attendance and other behavioral data</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>AI Model:</strong> A neural network trained on historical data processes the inputs to predict outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Results:</strong> The tool categorizes each student as:
        <ul>
            <li>Graduate</li>
            <li>Enrolled</li>
            <li>Dropout</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
